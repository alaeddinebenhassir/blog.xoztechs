## History of UNIX and Linux : 

### 1964-1974 Unix is borne : 

History is boring but  certain events shouldn't be denied as in the history of nations , well in this artical i am going to focuss only on the more remarcable events,
in other term  i am going to cover the big histroy of Unix . the folowing lines are my notes from [ UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook ](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Linux-System-Administration-Handbook/dp/0134277554)

Unix devlopement passed by sevral steps inside the AT&T Bell Labs back in the Seventies by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson the most cited names they were ,inspired by an ambitious time-sharing system called Multics devloped by MIT , General Electronics and Bell Labs in 1964.

The funny story that leaded  to the creation of the first virsion of Unix was the fact that in 1964 and after 5 manthes form Multrics project lanching , the bell labs pulled out fome some reasons , and left behind it servrel researchers with nothing to work on , tow of them—Ken Thompson, and Dennis Ritchie—know as survivors  liked the idea of multics tried again and the first version of Unix was single-user sys-tem.

By February 1973, there were already 16 UNIX installations. when Two big innovations had occurred to inhence the power of it.
1. **the “new” programming language, C** 
2. **the idea of a pipe : A pipe is a simple concept: a standardized way of connecting the output of one program to the input of another.**


The power of unix lies an the folwing philosophy : 

1. **Write programs that do one thing and do it well.**
2. **Write programs to work together (the pipe aproach is an exemple of it)**
3. **Write programs that handle text streams as a universal interface.**

>So the idea is to solve a problem by interconnecting simpler tools, rather than creating large 
> monolithic application programs — <cite>[^1]</cite> and it's the same approch used ini modern Linux systems.

### Devlopement of Unix :

Intel this time the Unix system is still stack between the doors of the AT&T Bell Labs, it had to escape and multiply. For some reasons that i wont descace in this artical the AT&T could not sell UNIX as a product and Bell Labs had to license its technology to others.  

Ken Thompson took the intiative and began shipping copies of the UNIX source code , and many computer scientists around the world showed thier intrests in unix and started working on thier own destrepbution as an enxemple ,the  Students at Berkeley enhanced the version of UNIX that they had received from Bell Labs to meet their needs. It was the first Berkeley tape (1BSD, short for 1 st Berkeley Software Distribution).Folowed by 2BSD ,3BSD and the 4BSD in witch the  TCP/IP sockets where introcuded for the first time .

In 1983, when AT&T started selling Unix commercially , about half of the source code was written by others.a big debate was lached thats why it has been to version of UNIX ; the AT&T UNIX System V , and the free BSD UNIX. 


### Conclusion : 

Learning the history may give s a good understanding to the phylosofy behind the modern linux system , history enable as to trace the futur paths.
I think every one wandring to jump into the world of opensorce should undestand the folowing :

* the phylosophy of unix 
* the roots of linux 
* the free software philosophy 
* licencing 

and this what what i tried to cover in this artical.
